# temperature-converter
 This is a small project I made, a simple Temperature converter tool.


# Converter tool
I started this small project with the idea of converting temperature values from Celsius to Kelvin, Fahrenheit and Newton. I see this as a good start to a more complex application that I'm envisioning.


## Technologies Used
This project was built using the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## Future plans for this project
I intend to invest more time in this project in the near future in order to add better UI and UX, and more functionality.
